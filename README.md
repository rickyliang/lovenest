# Climate Connect

Using data from your wearable to adapt your home surroundings to you.

## About Climate Connect

Nest makes your home adaptable, energy efficient, but Climate Connect allows you to truly customize and tune your environment to your body. Using data such as your sleeping pattern and your heart rate, Climate Connect is able to automatically control heating and cooling of your environment so it is the most comfortable for you.

## Technologies

The Climate Connect backend is a Django server that links your body to the Nest API. The wearable technology is a Pebble Time app that collects data on you and lets your Nest know when your climate needs an adjustment.
